ToggleTheSignal (v1)

How to play the game?



Considering there are nine signals(the one that going key from your keyboard), in 3x3 format, and their number as per this sequence:

  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9

Each number represents a signal digit, where has two state: 'O' as TRUE and 'X' as FALSE state.

Everytime when you selected a signal digit, the program will toggle the digit itself and others that surrounding it (not including crossing). For instance,

When selecting 
'1', digits 1, 2 and 4 will change
'5', digits 2, 4, 6, 8 will change
'8', digits 5, 7, 9 will change, 
etc...

At begining, there will have generated a random signal map(3x3) for playing the game and you need to toggle the signal by insert and enter the signal numebr to progress the game. 
The rule is simple: Toggle all signals till all signal digits (1-9) are under TRUE state.

Currently, no timer and stepcounter included, but will be added later. Thanks!
